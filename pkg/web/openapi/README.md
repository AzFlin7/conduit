# OpenAPI

This directory contains an abbreviated copy of the following repository:

* `swagger-ui` - https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui 91858cc811d3cddb45ef604365e2c88cd96e4ca0 (LICENSE, dist/)

The `swagger-ui` directory contains HTML, Javascript, and CSS assets that dynamically generate Swagger documentation
from a Swagger-compliant API definition in [api.swagger.json](./swagger-ui/api/v1/api.swagger.json) file.
That file is auto-generated by running `make proto` in the root of this repository. The static assets are copied
from [this dist folder](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/tree/master/dist) of the swagger-ui project. After
copying, [`index.html`](./swagger-ui/index.html) is edited to load the swagger file from the local server instead of the
default petstore.

See the [LICENSE](./swagger-ui/LICENSE) file for applicable license terms.
